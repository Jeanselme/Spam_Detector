Subject: Spam Detector

Just a few words about this spam detector, which allows to detect certain kind of
spams. However, we can see its limits when the typo is okay and there is no number
in the email. That would be interesting to extract other data from emails.
An other mail could be implemented to correlate the different features.

See you soon on my GitHub !
